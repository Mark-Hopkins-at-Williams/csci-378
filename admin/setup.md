# CSCI 121: Introduction to Computer Science

## First steps

This course is taught using Python 3. We recommend the following setup:

1. Go to https://www.anaconda.com/download.
2. Choose whether you're using Windows, Mac, or Linux by clicking on the appropriate icon. This will give you a choice of files to download.

3. Click the big green download button beneath the Python 3.7 version.

## Next steps for Mac users

1. Open the downloaded file, which should be called something like Anaconda3-2018.12-MacOSX-x86_64.pkg.
2. You may be asked whether or not you trust the provider of this file. If so, click "Continue".

3. Follow the remainder of the instructions from the installer (accept the license agreement, etc.) Note that the installation may take several minutes. You need not bother installing Microsoft VSCode (if asked). At the end, feel free to move the installer to the trash (if asked).

5. To make it easier to open Anaconda Navigator in the future, you may wish to right-click on the Anaconda icon (a green circle) in the dock at the bottom of the screen. Then go to Options -> Keep in Dock. In the future, this will allow you to open the Anaconda Navigator by clicking on the Anaconda icon in the dock.
